# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a frontend for an interactive tutoring platform that guides users through a three-stage learning process. Users upload math problems, receive tutoring guidance, practice being a tutor themselves, and complete the learning cycle. The platform uses a conversational interface with visual elements (sprites and backgrounds) to create an engaging learning experience.

## Technical Constraints

- The application SHALL be implemented using React
- The frontend SHALL be a single-page application (SPA)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with any username and password, so that I can access the tutoring platform and begin my learning session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a login/landing page
2. WHEN the user enters any username and password THEN the system SHALL accept the credentials
3. WHEN the user submits valid login information THEN the system SHALL navigate to the upload screen
4. IF the user leaves username or password empty THEN the system SHALL display a validation message
5. WHEN the user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store the username for the session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to upload a file or image containing math problems, so that I can begin the tutoring session with relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes login THEN the system SHALL display an upload interface with a file/image upload button
2. WHEN the user clicks the upload button THEN the system SHALL open a file selection dialog
3. WHEN the user selects a file THEN the system SHALL accept the file and proceed to the tutoring stage
4. IF no file is selected THEN the system SHALL remain on the upload screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to have a natural conversation with a tutor sprite, so that I can receive guided help to understand and solve math problems through realistic dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes file upload THEN the system SHALL display the tutoring screen with a sprite character and background
2. WHEN the tutoring screen loads THEN the system SHALL display a conversational interface that simulates talking with the sprite
3. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL display the conversation as natural dialogue between the user and sprite
4. WHEN the sprite responds THEN the system SHALL present the response as if the sprite is speaking directly to the user
5. WHEN the tutoring session progresses THEN the system SHALL display a button to proceed to the next stage
6. IF the user clicks the proceed button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the teaching stage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to practice being a tutor by having natural conversations with a student sprite, so that I can reinforce my understanding by teaching through realistic dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user proceeds from the tutoring stage THEN the system SHALL display the teaching screen with a different sprite and background
2. WHEN the teaching screen loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the same conversational interface functionality
3. WHEN the user engages in the teaching conversation THEN the system SHALL present the dialogue as natural conversation with the student sprite
4. WHEN the student sprite responds THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic student responses and questions
5. WHEN the teaching session is complete THEN the system SHALL display a button to proceed to the completion stage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a completion screen with ending dialogue and restart options, so that I can review my progress and start a new session if desired.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes the teaching stage THEN the system SHALL display the completion screen
2. WHEN the completion screen loads THEN the system SHALL show ending dialogue content
3. WHEN the completion screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a restart button
4. WHEN the user clicks restart THEN the system SHALL return to the initial upload screen
5. IF the user wants to try a new problem THEN the system SHALL provide an option to start over

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visually distinct environments for each stage, so that I can clearly understand which phase of the learning process I'm in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is in the tutoring stage THEN the system SHALL display a specific sprite character and background
2. WHEN the user is in the teaching stage THEN the system SHALL display a different sprite character and background from the tutoring stage
3. WHEN the user is in the completion stage THEN the system SHALL display appropriate visual elements for the ending
4. WHEN transitioning between stages THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the change in context through visual elements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and intuitive navigation experience, so that I can focus on learning rather than figuring out how to use the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on any screen THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of the current stage
2. WHEN navigation options are available THEN the system SHALL display them prominently
3. WHEN the user performs any action THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN engaging in conversation THEN the system SHALL present dialogue in a natural, flowing manner that simulates real conversation
5. IF the user needs to return to a previous stage THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history where appropriate
